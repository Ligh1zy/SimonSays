  This Guthub provides a comprehensive overview of the design, and implementation of the Simon Says project. The game was built using Java programming language and JavaFX, with the graphical interface created with Scene Builder and coded in IntelliJ IDEA Community. The core logic centers on generating and validating color sequences with flashing arcs that contain the classic Simon Saysâ€™ colors and original sounds. Additional menus such as the Main Menu, High Scores, and Game Over screens were implemented to enhance functionality. The scoring system tracks progress by awarding points for each completed round, checks if the result belongs in the top ten, and allows players to enter a three-letter name to save their score. 

  In addition to the core logic, special attention was given to the graphical user interface. The goal was to ensure that the game is not only functional but also user-friendly, minimalistic, and visually appealing.
